# CharacterWorks-Grid-Desktop
Register Windows Global Shortcut for CW

### This is a Desktop tool for Windows based on CW API & Electron
##### Grid is just same as original CW grid page
##### The only difference is you can use globalshortcut by this tool, but not need to focus on the grid window or remote page.

### There is still some shortcut key mapping problem with this tool
###### Because CW's shortcut is not so sensitivity,
###### Like 'num1' and '1' is totally same for CW, but It actually is different in Electron globalshortcut event,
